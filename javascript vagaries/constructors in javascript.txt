Whenever I did console.log( A.prototype ) then it always had that constructor property. I always wondered what that would be

say....

A = function(){
	this.x = 1
	this.getX(){
		return this.x;
	}
}
var b = new A() 

Above statements initializes b with the property x and getX. Therefore the whole function is called constructor
Therefore as A.prototype is the the property that all the child of A will have in common.
In this case constructor;
