Essentially prototype property means the property that is common to all of my child. normally a constructor. 
	    __proto__ property is the property that all the children "share" with the parent. normally a constructor

Emphasis on share because they are all "pointing" to the same property.
So, a child can mutate a __proto__property and have its effect globally

Example

funciton A(){
	this.x = 1;
}
A.prototype.p = 23;


var a = new A();
var b = new A();

console.log(A.prototype);
console.log(a.__proto__.p);    	//ALL RESULT IN 23
console.log(b.__proto__.p);


//here comes the mutation
a.__proto__.p = 20;

console.log(A.prototype);
console.log(a.__proto__.p);    	//ALL RESULT IN 20
console.log(b.__proto__.p);
