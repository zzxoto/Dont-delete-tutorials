-------OnBoarding------

Legend:
	flOrUp -> Field Leader Or Up.
	< ?? > -> Have implemented but Unsure if this is the desire behaviour. Need feedback.

HighLights and Concerns:
	I think I overdid with adding Histories. They are gonna pile up pretty heavily in these onboarding processes.
	req.body.note is optional for other routes but are mandatory for /reject and /schedule route.
	
	Are the following routes adequate?
	Is the /schedule/ route necessary.
	All the serial databases changes are done in transaction so no worries.
	I have tested all the routes.
	
	There seem to be problem in mailSystem and addPositionToUser
	Based on next suggestions I will ammend changes and commit thereafter.
	
There are 6 endpoints starting with "/api/onboarding/...."
All of the routes requires authentication


i) /:divisionId/:battalionId?
	
	Sends lists of application pretaining to that particular battalioinId and divisionId
	-requester is required to be flOrUp
	< ?? > DI cannot see the Applications

	
ii) /approve/:applicantId
	
	Application is approved.
	-OnboardingStep is created
	-History is added to the Application
	-Email is sent to user
	< ?? > Battalion Officer or above can approve
	
	
iii)  /reject/:applicantId

	Application is rejected.
	-Email is sent to user. The body of the message is passed in req.body.note
	< ?? > Rejection message ( length > 10 ) is mandatory
	< ?? > Battalion Officer or above can reject
	< ?? > DI cannot reject ( If applicant did not attend bootcamp how would DI reject him)?
	< ?? > Application and OnboardingStep are destroyed
	< ?? > Application rejected Note is added to both application and oboardingstep Histories
