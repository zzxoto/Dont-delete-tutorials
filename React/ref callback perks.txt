<Input ref={()=> {}} /> ---case 1

VS

<Input ref={this.someMethod} /> --case 2

In case 1:
	Whenever the render method is invoked the method inside the ref is re-created. So, react calls the method immediately everytime we want to render
In case 2:
	since the callback defined in ref is bound to our object, that means javascript doesn;t have to create the function. Thus, it doesn't get called unnecessarily


say u want to store the refs in an array,
In case 1:
	Every time render method is called all the duplicate refs are repushed into the array
In case 2:
	Everytime render method is called only the newly instantiated ref is pushed to the array
