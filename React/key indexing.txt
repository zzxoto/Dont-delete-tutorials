Consider react li tags with "Dumb" indexing i.e. map((x , index)=><li key={index}></index>));

1 Flower
2 Bat
3 Ball
4 Vase
5 Paper


Say I delete item at index 2 and trigger react DOM update
Now the list becomes

1 Flower
2 Ball
3 Vase
4 Paper

Because of our "dumb" indexing react had to delete the position 5 and update 2,3,4 positions as well. *Note React deletes item at position 5 NOT position 2
If instead had we provided unique indices to begin with, only change in DOM that would have been necessary would be deleting item "Bat" and no other would be necessary
